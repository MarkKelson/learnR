## Plotting your data 
Plotting is a key aspect of data analysis. It is valuable during two distinct phases: data exploration (at the beginning of the analysis cycle); and data presentation (often at the endo fthe analysis cycle). 

Base R will generate some interesting plots and it's always worth trying the plot() function to see what happens. Another useful function for multidimensional data is pairs() which allows multiple comparisons. 

The majority of this section will focus on using the ggplot2 library authors by Hadley Wickham. There is very good online documentation available <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/> and a book available on github <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book>

## Our inspiration
Our inspiration for this session is this graph published by the Economist a few years ago.

## Get the data
The data needs to be downloaded first. It has already been placed on github
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# first the 2011 Corruption Data index
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/LearnR/master/data/CPI2011_Results.xls"
download.file(url=link, destfile="file.xls", mode="wb")
corInd <- read_excel("file.xls")

# extract two columns we want
corInd <- corInd[,1:2]

# second bit of data is 
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/LearnR/master/data/2015_Statistical_Annex_Table_2TrendsHumanDevIndex.xls"
download.file(url=link, destfile="file.xls", mode="wb")
hdi <- read_excel("file.xls",
                  skip = 6, col_names = TRUE)

# column 2 with country names
# column 6 with 2011 data
# extract just these columns
hdi <- cbind(hdi[,2], hdi[,6])
# improve column names for merge
colnames(hdi) <- c("country", "hdi2011")

# now merge the two dataframes to create a new dataframe
# by country name
data <- merge(corInd[,1:2], hdi, by="country")
# interestingly just 161 observations. 
# still it's a good start. 
```

## Our first graph
Our data is in a data.frame. 
We can plot this data with the plot function
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(data$cpi11, data$hdi2011)

```

There are many ways to customise the plot but I'm not going to describe them. I'm going to go straight to using ggplot2. 
The key to understanding ggplot is that you assemble the data in stages. 
The first stage is attaching the data and then adding aesthetics (aes).
The tells ggplot what data to use and what parts of the data are to be used in the x dimension and the y dimesions. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011))
  
```  

The key thing to note is that we have a graph but no points. ggplot has set the axis and added titles based on the titles of the columns from which the data is taken. 
This is because we haven't told ggplot what kind of graph to prepare. There are many options, of course.

The options are often described as a geometry (geom) and a good example is geom_point

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
  geom_point()
  
```  

The geom_point now adds the points with the default settings. 

Note the is one warning - one row has been ignored. If we look at the data we see that this row is lacking a piece of data.

The documentation <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/geom_point.html> contains lots information about how geom_point() can be used. 

Here are some examples:
Colouring the points:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
  geom_point(colour = "red")
  
```  

Size and fill points:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "blue", fill = "white", size = 3, stroke = 1.25)
  
```  

Usually we create a plot object and then add details to the plot object. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
     geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "blue", fill = "white", size = 3, stroke = 1.25)
  
```  
This doesn't plot anything but creates a list object. 
This can be seen by looking at the environment window in RStudio which should look a bit like this picture:

To see the plot, type the name of the object
```{r, echo=TRUE}
p 
  
```  


We can display the object and add some extra details. 
These are just produced in the display. 
In this example we have added a title and we have labelled the x and y axis. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
p + ylab("Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)") +
    xlab("Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)") +
    ggtitle(paste("Corruption & human development"))
  
``` 


To be continued.....
